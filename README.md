# Dictionary Using a Binary Tree

### Usage

With this Dictionary you can:

-  Execute commands with two modes: Batch mode and interactive mode
    
    Once you launch the program, you find a prompt waiting for you to write a file name so it can use the batch mode or a command so it can use the interactive mode.
- Use cd and all other general commands available in UNIX shell.
- Use composed Commands << cmd1 ; cmd2 >> OR << cmd1 && cmd2 >> OR << cmd1 || cmd2 >>
- Check your history and trace your command lines:
- Check the History since the day you first started using the shell by typing “history” or you can find the last commands you wrote in the current session with ↑
- Have pipe Handling
- Have error Handling
And finally, you can exit whenever you want using << quit >>
